## 2. Project Conduct

### 2.1 Project Plan

Describe the rough WBS tasks and the estimated efforts. Clearly list team members responsible for:

- (a) Use case analysis & design
- (b) Solving design problems using patterns

### 2.2 Project Status

Describe the current project status. Highlight any outstanding issues.

## 3. System Design

### 3.1 Software Architecture

Use UML to describe the overall architecture (e.g., components, layers, packages).  
Mention tech stacks, frameworks, databases, etc.

### 3.2 Transition from Analysis to Design

List transition strategies that guide use case design.

#### 3.2.1 <Transition Strategy N>

Explain the changes from analysis model to design model:

- Types of impacted objects
- Use cases affected
- Structural changes in class diagrams
- Dynamic behavior changes in sequence diagrams
- Rationale for each change

### 3.3 Use Case Model

#### 3.3.1 Use Case Diagram

Include the overall UML use case diagram for the system.

#### 3.3.2 <Use Case Description N>

For each use case:

- Flow of events (basic and alternative flows)
- Preconditions and postconditions
- Actors involved

### 3.4 Analysis & Design Models

#### 3.4.1 <Use Case N> by <Name of Member M>

For each use case, include:

- Analysis Class Diagram
- Analysis Sequence Diagram(s)
- Design Class Diagram
- Design Sequence Diagram(s)

Ensure transitions follow the defined strategy.

### 3.5 Design Problems and Patterns

#### 3.5.1 <Design Problem N> by <Name of Member M>

Each problem should include:

- Description of the design problem
- Brute-force solution (optional)
- Candidate design patterns
- Justification for chosen pattern
- Class diagram (before & after)
- Sequence diagram (before & after)
- Key implementation decisions

### 3.6 Database Schemas

Provide the database schema using ER diagrams or SQL DDL where relevant.

## 4. DevSecOps and Development Lifecycle

### 4.1 Source Control Strategy

Describe the source code and config management strategy:

- Repository structure
- Branching strategy
- Developer authentication

### 4.2 Continuous Integration

Explain the CI pipeline:

- Triggers
- Jobs and tests executed
- Tools used (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

### 4.3 Continuous Delivery

Describe the CD pipeline:

- Number of environments
- Promotion/approval strategy
- How deployments are verified
